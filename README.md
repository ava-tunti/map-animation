## Real Time Bus Tracker - Ava Tunti
# Description:
This program will show a starting page of a marker on a map in Cambridge, Boston. When the program starts, the marker will move and stop at each bus stop from MIT to Harvard in one second intervals.

# Running Instructions:
Simply go to the link [Real Time Bus Tracker](https://ava-tunti.github.io/real-time-bus-tracker/) and click the button. Then, sit back and watch the marker stop at each bus stop for one second!

# Future Improvements:
Some possible improvements in the future would be to display info of each bus stop as it passes. For styling and displays, we could add a bus animation that drives along with the marker.
