## Real Time Bus Tracker - Ava Tunti
# Description:
This program shows a real-time bus tracker with a starting point in Cambridge, Boston. The marker on the map moves and makes stops at each bus stop along the route from MIT to Harvard at one second intervals. An exciting feature is that the marker changes color randomly every time it moves!

# Running Instructions:
Simply go to the link [Real Time Bus Tracker](https://ava-tunti.github.io/real-time-bus-tracker/) and click the button to start the program. Observe the marker stopping at each bus stop for one second. Enjoy the dynamic experience with the marker changing colors at every move.

# Future Improvements:
Potential future enhancements include displaying information about each bus stop as the marker passes. Stylistic improvements may involve adding a bus animation that moves in sync with the marker.
